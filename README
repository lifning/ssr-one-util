(with prs decompression routines by fuzziqer software, thanks a bunch!)
feel free to do anything with this source code as long as you offer the
source code to any modified versions or derivative works you make and
distribute.  I'd also appreciate if you credit me somewhere for whatever
code you use that's mine. this program may or may not work or be useful
to you, but it's offered in the hopes that it will.

C used should be fairly standard, so it should compile in any compliant
compiler.  tested with GNU gcc 4.1.2 on Linux kernel 2.6.23.12 (i386).

"sonic and the secret rings", prs format, and related are (c) sega
neither this program nor its author are associated with sega in any way.
